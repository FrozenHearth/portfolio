              I started out as a fullstack intern at Red Hat, although most of
              my work was frontend. I learnt Angular, Typescript, Mocha,
              Node.js, MongoDB and GraphQL on the job, successfully delivering a
              webapp for the internal teams at Red Hat.
              <br />

              {`After my internship at Red Hat, I worked at a
        couple of small startups, where I worked with Vue, Vuex, Nuxt, React, Redux, etc. Transitioning
        from a big company to a small startup was an overwhelming change. It was a tremendous learning experience, as I
        got to witness firsthand the inner workings of a bootstrapped startup. I built a few frontend webapps from scratch, ranging from a Trello-like platform for C-suite executives to Udemy-like learning platform for senior citizens.`}

              built with React, Redux, Bootstrap, Storybook and Agora. 
              Perhaps the most fun, memorable and chaotic memory
        was fixing a Webpack build error, which broke the background image for
        one of the most important parts of our webapp. After hours of debugging
        with the team, frantically searching on Stackoverflow and reading the
        documentation, I figured out the fix, which saved tons of money for the
        company, and prevented delays in our production launch.`}
